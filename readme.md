## Neural Machine Translation Mini Experiment.

Make a mini test of neural machine translation.

Environment:

Tensorflow: >= 1.2

Experiment Points:

+ Seq2Seq in tensorflow
    + Encoder
    + Decoder
    + Optimizer
+ Attention Model in tensorflow.

+ Data Pipeline in tensorflow.


The experiment language:

change a sequence on english characters into a sequence
 of their ASCII codes.

 e.g:

 'abcdef' ==> '979899100101102'
